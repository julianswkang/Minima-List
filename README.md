# Minima-List

Minima-List is a minimal productivity application that lets you track tasks that you want to complete. It is an easy-to-use application that requires no intense start up.

## Getting started

Start by logging in by clicking Log In at the top right. If you haven't made an account yet, get started by clicking Sign Up!

After logging in/signing up, you will be redirected to the main page where you can get started! You can add a task by filling in the input field and choosing a priority level. After this is done, you can click the button or press 'Enter' on your keyboard to add the task.

Once you have completed the task, you may remove it from your list by clicking 'Finished'!

And that's it! Simple, easy-to-use, and minimal. I hope you find use out of it!
